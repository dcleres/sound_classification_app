# Sound Classification Application for Android Phones

This project was done for the Center for Digital Health Interventions 
in the frame of the Challenge for technical applicants.

=============================================================================

## Aim

Take no more than 2-3 days to write a small android application which classifies singing vs speaking vs silence of the last 2 seconds based on microphone sensor data. Your solution should utilise at least one machine learning approach. You are welcome to make use of third party libraries as long as they are not pre-trained on the specific task at hand. The classification results should be displayed on the screen.

## Deliverable

In case you accept this challenge, provide us with a small set of slides describing your approach, the commented source code and a compiled .apk supporting Android 6.0+.

## Use dataset
