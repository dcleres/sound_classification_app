"""
The file is organised in the following way:
- ignore: errors to ignore at commit.
- max-line-length: Maximal length of a code line.
- max-complexity: McCabe Cyclomatic Complexity (e.g., as discussed in NIST 500-235) is a measure of the complexity of a piece of software. Rather than counting the number of lines of code, cyclomatic complexity (roughly speaking) counts the number of decision points within the software.
Additional information regardingthe ignore field. All the Flake rules can be found here (https://www.flake8rules.com/):
- E203: Whitespace before ':'
- E266: Too many leading '#' for block comment
- E501: Line too long (82 > 79 characters)
- W503:	Line break occurred before a binary operator
- F403: 'from module import *' used; unable to detect undefined names
- C901: Function is too complex
- E402: Module level import not at top of file
- F811: redefinition of unused name from line N
