This is a list of interesting datasets to differentiate between silence, speech, and signing: 

- [LibriSpeech](http://www.openslr.org/12/) : This dataset is a large-scale corpus of around 1000 hours of English speech. The data has been sourced from audio books from the LibriVox project and is 60 GB in size.
- [VoxCeleb](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/voxceleb/)
VoxCeleb is a large-scale speaker identification dataset. It contains around 100,000 utterances by 1,251 celebrities, extracted from You Tube videos. The data is mostly gender balanced (males comprise of 55%). The celebrities span a diverse range of accents, professions, and age. There is no overlap between the development and test sets. It’s an intriguing use case for isolating and identifying which superstar the voice belongs to.
This set is 150 MB in size and has about 2000 hours of speech.
- [The Spoken Wikipedia Corpora](https://nats.gitlab.io/swc/)
This is a corpus of aligned spoken Wikipedia articles from the English, German, and Dutch Wikipedia. Hundreds of hours of aligned audio and annotations can be mapped back to the original HTML. The entire set is about 38 GB in size available in both audio and without audio format.
- [TED-LIUM](http://www.openslr.org/51/)
Audio transcription of TED talks. 1495 TED talks audio recordings along with full-text transcriptions of those recordings, created by Laboratoire d’Informatique de l’Université du Maine (LIUM).
- [AudioSet](https://research.google.com/audioset/): An expanding ontology of 632 audio event classes and a collection of 2,084,320 human-labeled 10-second sound clips drawn from YouTube videos. To download this set, click on this GitHub [link](https://github.com/audioset/ontology).
